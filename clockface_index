<p><strong>I had some fun with this assignment! I did run into some problems though, but the codespace helper helped me fix my mistakes.<br>
    When I tried to change the numbers to roman numerals it completely borked the code at first and I thought I was going to have to fetch the original code again from W3Schools,<br> but thankfully it just turned out to be a simple spelling error.</strong></p>
