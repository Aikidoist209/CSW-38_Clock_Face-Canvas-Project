<p><strong>I had some fun with this assignment! I did run into some problems though, but the codespace help agent provided a lot of help with debugging.
For instance, when I tried to change the numbers to roman numerals it completely borked the code at first and I thought I was going to have to fetch the original code again from W3Schools, but thankfully the issue just turned out to be a simple spelling error.</strong></p>
